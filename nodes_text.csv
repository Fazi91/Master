T_00001,1,414,"World Health Organization Geneva This manual provides a practical guide to the safe and accurate performance of basic laboratory techniques. Intended for use by laboratory technicians working in peripheral-level laboratories in developing countries, the book emphasizes simple, economical procedures that can yield accurate results where resources, including equipment, are scarce and the climate is hot and humid. The book is divided into three parts. The first describes the setting-up of a peripheral health laboratory and general laboratory procedures, including use of a microscope and laboratory balances, centrifugation, measurement and dispensing of liquids, and cleaning, disinfection and sterilization of laboratory equipment. Methods of disposal of laboratory waste, dispatch of specimens to reference laboratories and labora- tory safety are also discussed. The second part describes techniques for the examination of different specimens for helminths, protozoa, bacteria and fungi. Techniques for the preparation, fixation and staining of smears are also discussed. The third and final part describes the examination of urine, cerebrospinal fluid and blood, including techniques based on immunological and serological principles. For each technique, a list of materials and reagents is given, followed by a detailed description of the method and the results of microscopic examination. Numerous illustrations are used throughout the book to clarify the different steps involved. A summary of the reagents required for the various techniques and their preparation is provided in the annex.

One of WHO’s constitutional functions is to provide objective and reliable information and advice in the field of human health, a responsibility that it fulfils in part through its extensive programme of publications. The Organization seeks through its publications to support national health strategies and address the most pressing public health concerns of populations around the world. To respond to the needs of Member States at all levels of development, WHO publishes practical manuals, handbooks and training material for specific categories of health workers; internationally applicable guidelines and standards; reviews and analyses of health policies, programmes and research; and state-of-the-art consensus reports that offer technical advice and recommendations for decision-makers."

These books are closely tied to the Organization’s priority activities, encompassing disease prevention and control, the development of equitable health systems based on primary health care, and health promotion for individuals and communities. Progress towards better health for all also demands the global dissemination and exchange of information that draws on the knowledge and experience of all WHO’s Member countries and the collaboration of world leaders in public health and the biomedical sciences. To ensure the widest possible availability of authoritative information and guidance on health matters, WHO secures the broad international distribution of its publications and encourages their translation and adaptation. By helping to promote and protect health and prevent and control disease throughout the world, WHO’s books contribute to achieving the Organization’s principal objective – the attainment by all people of the highest possible level of health.

The revision was necessary because of new procedures and technology that have been developed since the previous edition and that have proved to be useful to small laboratories in developing countries. The procedures have been included in the relevant sections of the manual, and some obsolete procedures have been replaced by more up-to-date techniques. The original objective of the manual remains unchanged. It is intended mainly for the use of laboratory personnel in developing countries during their training and thereafter in their work. In the selection of techniques, particular attention has been paid to the low cost, reliability and simplicity of the methods and to the availability of resources in small laboratories.

Such procedures include the following: — the examination of stools for helminth eggs; — the examination of blood for malaria parasites; — the examination of sputum for tubercle bacilli; — the examination of urine for bile pigments; — the examination of blood for determination of the white cell (leukocyte) type number fraction (differential leukocyte count) — the examination of blood for determination of the glucose concentration. The intention is to provide an account of basic laboratory techniques that are useful to peripheral laboratories and can be carried out with a limited range of basic equipment. Some laboratories may not be able to perform all the procedures described. For example, a laboratory in a rural health centre may not be able to carry out certain blood chemistry or serological tests. 1.2 Reagents and equipment 1.2.1 Reagents Each reagent has been given a number. The reagents required and their numbers are indicated in the description of each technique.

In most countries there are high moral and professional standards of behaviour for clinical staff and qualified laboratory personnel. Every laboratory worker handling clinical materials must maintain these standards. 1.4 Units of measurement In the laboratory you will work extensively with both quantities and units of measurement, and it is important to understand the difference between them. Any measurable physical property is called a quantity. Note that the word “quantity” has two meanings; the scientific meaning just defined and the everyday mean- ing “amount of”. In scientific usage height, length, speed, temperature and electric current are quantities, whereas the standards in which they are measured are units. 1.4.1 Quantities and units in the clinical laboratory Almost all your work in the laboratory will involve making measurements of quantities and using units for reporting the results of those measurements. Since the health — and even the life — of a patient may depend on the care with which you make a measurement and the way in which you report the results, you should thoroughly understand: — the quantities you measure; — the names that are given to those quantities; — the units that are used to measure the quantities. 1.4.2 SI units and names for quantities A simple standardized set of units of measurement has been the goal of scientists for almost two centuries."

The metric system was introduced in 1901. Since then this system has been gradually expanded, and in 1960 it was given the name “Systè me international d ’Unité s” (International System of Units) and the international abbreviation “SI”. Units of measurement that form part of this system are called “SI units”. These units have been used to an increasing extent in the sciences, especially chemistry and physics, since 1901 (long before they were called SI units), but most of them were introduced into medicine only after 1960. To accompany the introduction of SI units, medical scientists prepared a systematic list of names for quantities. Some of these names are the same as the traditional ones; in other cases, however, the traditional names were inaccurate, misleading or ambiguous, and new names were introduced to replace them. This manual uses SI units and the currently accepted names for quantities. However, since traditional units and names for quantities are still used in some laborato- ries, these are also included and the relationship between the two is explained. <> 1. Introduction 3 The following section gives a brief description of the SI units and of the quantity names that are used in this manual. SI units used in this manual All SI units are based on seven SI base units . Only four of them are used in this manual; they are listed in T able 1.1.

Mass is the correct term for what is commonly called “weight”. (There is a technical meaning of the term “weight”: it is a measure of the force with which the earth’s gravity attracts a given mass. Mass, on the other hand, is independent of the earth’s gravitational attraction. The two terms are mixed up in everyday usage; furthermore, we speak of measuring a mass as “weighing”.) “Amount of substance ” and its unit, mole, are important terms in medicine and they will affect your work in the laboratory more than any other quantities or SI units. When two or more chemical substances react together, they do not do so in relation to their mass. For example: sodium hydrochloric Æ sodium carbon bicarbonate + acid chloride + dioxide + water In this reaction 1kg (1 kilogram) of sodium bicarbonate does not react with 1kg of hydrochloric acid; in fact, 1mol (1 mole) of sodium bicarbonate reacts with 1mol of hydrochloric acid. Whenever chemical substances interact, they do so in relation to their relative molecular mass (the new name for what used to be called “molecular weight”). Use of the mole, which is based on the relative molecular mass, there- fore gives a measure of equivalent amounts of two or more different substances (use of mass units does not)."

Use of the mole, which is based on the relative molecular mass, there- fore gives a measure of equivalent amounts of two or more different substances (use of mass units does not). Most of the SI units are called SI derived units . These are obtained by combining the SI base units (by multiplication or division) as appropriate. Some common SI derived units are shown in Table 1.2. The unit of area is metre ¥ metre = metre squared or square metre; the unit of volume is metre ¥ metre ¥ metre = metre cubed or cubic metre; and the unit of speed is metre divided by second = metre per second. All the SI derived units are obtained in this simple way. In some cases, however, it is necessary to multiply and <> 4 Manual of basic techniques for a health laboratory divide several times, and the resulting expression becomes very cumbersome; for example, the unit of pressure is kilogram divided by (metre ¥ second ¥ second). To avoid this dif ficulty such units are given special names. For example, the unit of pressure is called the pascal. If the SI base units and derived units were the only ones available, measurements would be difficult because these units are too large or too small for many purposes. For example, the metre is far too large to be convenient for measurement of the diameter of a red blood cell (erythrocyte). T o overcome this difficulty, the SI incorporates a series of pre fixes, called SI prefixes , which when added to the name of a unit multiply or divide that unit by a certain factor, giving decimal multiples or submultiples of the unit. The SI prefixes used in this manual are listed in Table 1.3.

These prefixes have the same meaning when they are applied to any other unit. Quantity names used in this manual Certain names for quantities were introduced to accompany the change to SI units. Most of these names are used to describe concentration and related quantities. Units for measurement of concentration The difficulty with concentration is that it can be expressed in different ways. Traditionally all of these were called simply “concentration”, which was misleading. Now each different way of expressing concentration has its own special name. Before these names can be described, it is necessary to explain the unit of volume called the “litre” (l). Y ou are probably familiar with this unit of volume, and may have been surprised that it has not already been mentioned. This is because the litre is not an SI unit. The SI derived unit of volume is the cubic metre, but this is far too large to be convenient for measurements of body fluids. A submultiple of the cubic metre is therefore used; the cubic decimetre. The prefix “deci” was not listed above because it is not used in this manual, but it means division by 10 (or multiplication by 0.1 or 10 -1). A decimetre is therefore 0.1m, and a cubic decimetre is 0.1 ¥ 0.1 ¥ 0.1m3 = 0.001m 3 (or 10-3 m3; that is, one-thousandth of a cubic metre)."

The prefix “deci” was not listed above because it is not used in this manual, but it means division by 10 (or multiplication by 0.1 or 10 -1).

The name “litre”, although not part of the SI, has been approved for use as a special name for the cubic decimetre. The litre and its submultiples, such as the millilitre (ml), are used mainly for measuring relatively small volumes of liquids and sometimes gases; volumes of solids and large volumes of liquids and gases are usually measured in terms of the cubic metre or one of its multiples or submultiples. The litre is the unit used in the clinical laboratory for reporting all concentrations and related quantities. However, you may encounter (for example, on graduated glassware) volumes <> 1. Introduction 5 marked in terms of submultiples of the cubic metre. The equivalent submultiples of the cubic metre and of the litre are listed in T able 1.4. Having explained the litre, we can now return to the names for different ways of expressing concentration. First, suppose that we have a solution of salt. The mass of dissolved salt divided by the volume of solution is called the mass concentration. A more general definition of mass concentration is “the mass of a given component (e.g. a dissolved substance) divided by the volume of solution ”. The unit in which it is measured is gram (or milligram, microgram, etc.) per litre."

The unit in which it is measured is gram (or milligram, microgram, etc.) per litre. In the SI mass concentration is rarely used; it is used only for substances such as proteins whose relative molecular mass is uncertain. Now suppose that we have another solution of salt, only this time the amount of dissolved salt is expressed in terms of the “amount of substance ”. The amount of substance of salt (that is, the number of moles of salt) contained in the solution divided by the volume of the solution is called the amount of substance concentration, or, for short, the substance concentration. The unit in which substance concen- tration is measured is mole (or millimole, micromole, etc.) per litre. When SI units are used all concentrations are expressed in terms of substance concentration wherever possible. This use of substance concentration instead of mass concentration is the most important difference between the use of SI units and the use of traditional units. In the traditional system mass concentration was used almost exclusively. However, mass concentration was not, in the traditional system, always expressed in terms of “per litre”. Sometimes “per litre” was used, sometimes “per 100ml ” (0.1 litre), and sometimes “per millilitre”.

For particles or entities that are not dissolved, a different quantity must be used. For example, the blood contains many different kinds of cell. These cells are suspended in the blood, and we must have a way of expressing the number of cells in each litre of blood. In this case the quantity name is the number concentration, which is defined as “the number of speci fied particles or entities in a mixture divided by the volume of the mixture”. The unit in which number concentration is measured is number per litre. In the traditional system number concentration was called a “count” and it was expressed in the unit “number per cubic millimetre ”. Sometimes the quantity that is of concern is not the actual number of cells per litre (number concentration) but the proportion of cells of a given type — that is, the fraction of the total number that is accounted for by cells of that type. This quantity is called the number fraction, and it is expressed as a fraction of 1.0 (unity). At first sight this may seem a little confusing, but it is really very simple. Unity or 1.0 represents the whole, 0.5 represents one-half, 0.2 one- fifth, 0.25 one-quarter, 0.1 one-tenth, and so on."

(If you add these fractions, you will find that the total is 1.0 — the whole.) In the traditional system this quantity had no name and results were reported as percentages instead of fractions. For example, a number fraction of 0.5 was reported as 50%, and a number fraction of 0.08 was reported as 8%. From this you will see that percentage divided by 100 gives the number fraction. Another quantity that is expressed as a fraction of 1.0 is the volume fraction. This is defined as the volume of a speci fied component of a mixture divided by the total volume of the mixture. For example, if the total volume occupied by all the erythrocytes in 1 litre (1000ml) of blood is 450ml, the erythrocyte volume fraction is 450/1000 = 0.45. The erythrocyte volume fraction is important for the diagnosis of many diseases and you will often measure it in the laboratory. In the traditional system volume fraction had no special name: instead, each different volume fraction had a different name.

Setting up a peripheral health laboratory 13 — mains electricity supply — generators — solar energy supply system. Remote laboratories often have problems in ensuring a continuous supply of electrical power and may need to generate electricity by using a local generator or a solar energy supply system. 2.2.1 Sources of electricity Generators Electrical energy can be provided by a fuel generator. It is possible to use the combustion engine of a motor car or a purpose-built generator. A purpose-built genera- tor produces an alternating current of 110 volts (V) or 220V and can usually generate more energy than a car engine. A car engine provides a direct current of 12V or 24V, which can be fed into rechargeable batteries (see below). The type of current available will limit the selection of laboratory equipment; for example, an instrument that requires direct current can be supplied with energy from: — batteries — a direct current network with a transformer — an alternating current network with a converter. The installation of a direct current network is simple and it is safe to operate. However, for instruments that require a low-voltage (6V, 12V or 24V) direct current, the high voltage produced from the direct current network must be converted by means of a transformer. Alternatively, for instruments that require alternating current (110V, 220V or 240V), the direct current must be converted into alternating current by means of an inverter."

Alternatively, for instruments that require alternating current (110V, 220V or 240V), the direct current must be converted into alternating current by means of an inverter. Inverters are heavy and expensive and significant energy losses occur in the conversion process. It is therefore preferable to use either direct current or alternating current appliances, depending on your supply, and avoid the need for conversion. If no generator is available or if a mains power supply is accessible, but the electrical current fluctuates or is prone to frequent breakdowns, a solar energy supply may be preferable (see below). Solar energy supply systems (photovoltaic systems) A laboratory with a few instruments with low energy requirements can work with a small energy supply. For laboratories located in remote areas, a solar energy supply system may be more suitable than a generator since there are no problems of fuel supplies and it can be easily maintained. A solar energy supply system has three components: — solar panel(s) — an electronic charge regulator — batteries. Solar panels Two different types of solar panel are commercially available: — panels with cells of crystalline silicon — panels with cells of amorphous silicon.

They should be inclined at an angle of 15°. The underside of the panel must be freely ventilated. The minimum distance of the underside of the panel from the surface of the supporting construction must be more than 5cm to avoid heating of the panel, which would reduce the efficiency of energy production. Electronic charge regulators A charge regulator controls the charging and discharging of the batteries automatically. When the battery voltage falls below a threshold value during discharge, the laboratory instrument will be disconnected from the battery. On the other hand, if the voltage increases above a threshold value (e.g. when the battery is recharged), the solar panel will be disconnected from the battery. A good charge regulator adapts the maximal voltage of the battery to the change in the temperature of the ambient environment. This prevents the loss of water in the battery by evaporation. It is important to keep a spare charge regulator in stock in case of breakdown. The charge regulator chosen should be stable under tropical conditions. It is advisable to choose a charge regulator with an integrated digital display that allows the battery charge to be monitored easily. Batteries Lead batteries Solar energy systems require rechargeable batteries, which may be either lead or nickel–cadmium (Ni–Cd) batteries.

Batteries Lead batteries Solar energy systems require rechargeable batteries, which may be either lead or nickel–cadmium (Ni–Cd) batteries. Lead batteries are preferred and many types are available commercially (see Table 2.1). High-efficiency batteries have practical advantages, although they are more expensive than normal batteries. When purchasing batteries choose 12V batteries with the highest capacity (1000 ampere-hours (Ah)). Several types of maintenance-free lead batteries are commercially available, but they are expensive and less ef ficient than those that require maintenance. The development of this type of battery is still in progress; it has not been thoroughly tested in tropical climates. Therefore, the maintenance-free batteries are not recommended. Transport of lead batteries Lead batteries should be emptied before being transported. It is important to remember that if lead batteries are to be transported by air they must be empty of electrolyte solution, which should be replaced on arrival at the destination.

Setting up a peripheral health laboratory 15 Maintenance of lead batteries The daily discharge of lead batteries should not exceed 20% of the batteries ’ capacity, otherwise the lifetime of the batteries (normally about 1100 recharge cy- cles), will be shortened. If the batteries are repeatedly discharged to 40% of their capacity, they will last for only about 600 cycles. (There are some special lead batteries available that can be discharged by 40%, but will last for about 3000 recharge cycles.) For maintenance the level of fluid must be checked regularly and when necessary refilled with the distilled water that is used for car batteries. High-efficiency batteries cannot be replaced by normal car batteries in case of a breakdown. When only car batteries are available to replace a defective high-efficiency battery, all the batteries in the energy storage system must be replaced with car batteries. Nickel–cadmium (Ni–Cd) batteries Ni–Cd batteries can be recharged by a solar panel. Some Ni –Cd batteries are the same size, but have different capacities.

This apparent unreliability is caused by an increased rate of discharge rather than inef ficient recharging of the battery at high ambient temperatures (see below). Such problems may be partially overcome as follows: G Ni–Cd batteries should be recharged at a low ambient temperature (e.g. in a refrigerator or in a specially constructed recharging box) shortly prior to being used. (For example, only 62% of the energy can be made available from a Ni–Cd battery that was charged at 40 °C.) G Recharged Ni–Cd batteries should be stored under cool, dry conditions to minimize their rate of self-discharge. (For example, a Ni –Cd battery stored for 2 weeks at 40 °C will have a residual capacity of only 32%.) High humidity will also accelerate the self-discharge of the battery. 2.2.2 Setting up simple electrical equipment If the laboratory has an electricity supply the following equipment can be used: — an electric lamp for the microscope (stable illumination makes adjustment easier); — an electric centrifuge (much faster than the manually operated type); — a microhaematocrit centrifuge (for detection of anaemia); — a spectrophotometer or colorimeter (allows accurate estimation of haemoglobin); — a water-bath, refrigerator etc. Y ou may have to make simple connections or repairs to this equipment in the laboratory."

The instrument has a label on it stating the voltage with which it must be used. The voltage of your electricity supply is marked on your electricity meter. Dual-voltage equipment Dual-voltage instruments can be used with two different voltage supplies. There is a device on the instrument that enables you to select the appropriate voltage, i.e. the voltage marked on your electricity meter. Depending on the instrument, this device may be: — a lever or switch that can be moved to the 110V position or the 220V position (Fig. 2.4(a)); — an unwired plug that can be transferred from the 110V position to the 220V position (Fig. 2.4(b)); — a screw that can be turned to the 110V position or the 220V position (Fig. 2.4(c)).

Each piece of electrical equipment in the laboratory uses a certain amount of power. The total power used at any one time must not exceed the power of your electricity supply. Y ou can work out how much power is available from the figures shown on the meter: multiply the voltage (V) by the current (A). For example, if the voltage is 220V and the current is 30A, the electrical power supplied will be 220 ¥ 30 = 6600 watts or 6.6kW . Using a transformer If an instrument is intended for use with a voltage different from that of the laboratory electricity supply, it can be used with a transformer. For example, if the centri- fuge provided only works at 110V and the voltage of your electricity supply is 220V, ask for a 110 –220V transformer, indicating the wattage of the centrifuge. Plug the centrifuge into the 110V connection of the transformer supplied, then plug the 220V lead from the transformer into the laboratory electricity supply (wall socket).

The whole trap is attached to the waste pipe by a joint (J3). The wastewater flows into the trap, which is permanently filled with water (the seal). This prevents foul air from the waste pipes and sewers from coming up into the sink. Sink traps may become blocked so that wastewater from the sink or basin cannot drain away.

Preparation Demineralized water is prepared by passing ordinary water through a column of ion-exchange resin. The apparatus consists of a long cartridge filled with ionexchange resin granules. The water filters through the column of granules, which retain all the mineral ions (i.e. all the dissolved mineral salts). Some demineralizers have two cartridges through which the water passes successively (Fig. 2.34). 1. Check that the cartridge is completely filled with ion-exchange resin granules. 2. Connect the inlet tube of the apparatus to the water supply (a tap or a small tank placed above the apparatus). In some models the water flows in at the top of the column, in others it flows in at the bottom. 3. Let the water flow in slowly. 4. Collect the demineralized water in a closed container. <> 28 Manual of basic techniques for a health laboratory Quality control Apparatus with a control dial The dial registers the resistivity of the water resulting from the presence of ions.

To check that the battery is charged, press the button marked “zero test”; the needle on the dial should swing to zero (Fig. 2.35(a)). 3. Let water flow into the cartridge. 4. When demineralized water begins to flow out at the other end, press the button marked “water test”. The needle should register a resistivity of over 2 megaohms/ cm (2M W/cm) (Fig. 2.35(b)). 5. If the needle stops at a point below 2M W/cm or stays at zero, the cartridge of ion-exchange resin granules has been used for too long and must be replaced or reactivated. The apparatus may indicate the resistivity (M W/cm) or the reciprocal value, the conductivity (cm/MW or Siemens, S).

Numbering the specimens (Fig. 2.60) Give each specimen a number as soon as it is received. Write this number immediately: — on the request form — on the specimen container (use a grease pencil) — on every test-tube used for the specimen — on every microscope slide used for the specimen. This will prevent any mistakes. Laboratory registers Each numbered specimen should be recorded in a register for that type of specimen. The following registers are suggested: — haematology — blood chemistry — urine analysis — CSF examination — pregnancy tests — bacteriology — parasitology — mycology — serology (if the samples are few, incorporate in the bacteriology register; otherwise keep a separate register) — histopathology — water analysis."

It is a precision instrument and requires careful maintenance to prevent damage to the me- chanical and ocular parts and also to stop fungi from obscuring the lenses. 3.1.1 Components of a microscope The various components of the microscope can be classified into four systems: — the support system — the magnification system — the illumination system — the adjustment system. Support system (Fig. 3.1) This consists of: — the foot (1) — the limb (2) — the revolving nosepiece (objective changer) (3) — the stage (4) — the mechanical stage (5), which gives a slow controlled movement to the object slide. Magnification system (Fig. 3.2) This consists of a system of lenses. The lenses of the microscope are mounted in two groups, one at each end of the long tube — the body tube. G The first group of lenses is at the bottom of the tube, just above the preparation under examination (the object), and is called the objective.

The greater the numerical aperture, the greater the resolving power (see below). Moreover, the greater the numerical aperture, the smaller the front lens mounted at the base of the objective. The front lens of the ¥ 100 objective is the size of a pinhead, so handle it with care. Other fi gures that may be marked on the sleeve The sleeve may also display: — the recommended length in millimetres of the tube (between the objective and the eyepiece) — usually 160mm; — the recommended thickness in millimetres of the coverslip used to cover the object slide — e.g. 0.16mm. The screw threads of all objectives are standard, so the objectives in the revolving nosepiece are interchangeable. Working distance The working distance of an objective is the distance between the front lens of the objective and the object slide when the image is in focus. The greater the magnifying power of the objective, the smaller the working distance (Fig. 3.5): — ¥ 10 objective: the working distance is 5 –6mm — ¥ 40 objective: the working distance is 0.5 –1.5mm — ¥ 100 objective: the working distance is 0.15 –0.20mm."

Fig. 3.5 Working distance of an objective Resolving power The resolving power of an objective is its ability to reveal closely adjacent details as separate and distinct. The greater the resolving power of the objective, the clearer the image. The maximum resolving power of a good medical laboratory microscope is about 0.25 mm (the resolving power of the normal human eye is about 0.25mm). Immersion oil increases the resolving power by conserving many light rays that would be lost by refraction if a dry objective were used. <> 56 Manual of basic techniques for a health laboratory Eyepiece Magnifi cation The magnifying power of the eyepiece is marked on it (Fig. 3.6): — a ¥ 5 eyepiece magnifies the image produced by the objective five times; — a ¥ 10 eyepiece magnifies the image 10 times.

To calculate the total magnification of the object observed, multiply the magnifying power of the objective by that of the eyepiece. Microscopes used in medical laboratories have a mag- nifying power of between ¥ 50 and ¥ 1000. Certain eyepieces have a calibrated graticule. These eyepieces are used to measure the size of an object under the microscope (e.g. protozoan cysts). Binocular microscopes Binocular microscopes (two eyepieces but using only one objective at a time) are generally recommended. They are less tiring for the eyes than monocular microscopes when long examinations have to be made. Electric illumination is, however, essential for using the ¥ 100 objective. Illumination system Light source An electric light source is preferable, since it is easy to adjust. It is provided either by a lamp built into the microscope beneath the stage, or by an external lamp placed in front of the microscope. Mirror The mirror reflects rays from the light source onto the object. One side has a plane surface, the other a concave surface (Fig. 3.7). The concave side forms a low-power condenser and is not intended to be used if the microscope already has a condenser.

A porcelain holder for a light bulb is fixed on a wooden base and the whole is encased in a wooden or tin box with an opening for the light (Fig. 3.12). Cut slits in the top of the box to enable the bulb to cool. Alternatively, a flap can be fitted above the opening to serve as a shutter (Fig. 3.13).

If the stop is too large, insufficient light will be available to illuminate the specimen. 3.1.6 Routine maintenance Microscopes must be installed in a clean environment, away from chemicals. Workplaces should be well ventilated or permanently air-conditioned (intermittent use of air conditioners produces condensed water). The microscope needs daily attention to keep it in good working order and thus to ensure reliable laboratory results. Optical instruments should not be kept for long periods in closed compartments since these conditions also favour fungal growth which can corrode optical surfaces. Special care is required in hot and humid climates. Cleaning the microscope Microscopes are used to investigate biological tissues and fluids and must therefore be decontaminated at regular intervals.

General laboratory procedures 65 Maintaining the microscope When you carry out repair and maintenance procedures, take care not to confuse the condenser centring screws with the condenser clamp screws. T o maintain the microscope proceed as follows: G Check the mechanical stage. G Check the focusing mechanism. G Remove any fungal growth. G Check the diaphragm. G Clean all mechanical parts. G Lubricate the microscope according to the manufacturer ’s instructions. G Check the spring load on the specimen clamp. T oo high a tension may result in breakage of slides and damage to the clamp. G Check the optical alignment. A dim appearance of the specimen is often due to misalignment of the optical parts rather than to insuf ficient light. Precautions G Never dip the objectives in xylene or ethanol, as this may cause the lenses to become detached. G Never use ordinary paper to clean the lenses. G Never touch the lenses with your fingers. G Never clean the support or the stage with xylene or acetone. G Never clean the inside lenses of the eyepieces and objectives with cloth or paper (this might remove the anti-re flective coating); use a soft camel-hair brush, a fine paintbrush or a blower instead. G Never leave the microscope without the eyepieces unless the openings are plugged. G Never keep the microscope in a closed wooden box in hot humid countries."

Humid climates In hot, humid climates and during the wet season in hot, dry climates, fungi may grow on the microscope, particularly on the surface of the lenses, in the grooves of the screws and under the paint, and the instrument will soon be useless. This can be prevented as described below. Always keep the microscope under an airtight plastic cover when not in use, together with a dish filled with blue silica to dry the air under the cover. (The silica will turn red when it has lost its capacity to absorb moisture from the air. It can be simply regenerated by heating in a hot-air oven or over a fire.) The microscope must be cleaned daily to get rid of dust. These procedures must be carried out regularly, and are essential in conjunction with repair and maintenance procedures. 3.2 Weighing: use of laboratory balances Balances may be either electrically or manually operated.

Electric centrifuges Electric centrifuges are more accurate than hand-operated centrifuges and should be used whenever possible. Electric centrifuges are used with two types of head — the “swing-out” head and the “angle” head. “Swing-out” head (Fig. 3.38) The head is designed to swing the tubes out to a horizontal position during centrifuging. This is the type most frequently needed. “Angle” head (Fig. 3.39) The “angle” head holds the tubes at an angle of about 45° during centrifuging. It is useful for certain techniques, e.g. agglutination tests in blood-grouping by the testtube method. <> 3. General laboratory procedures 71 Buckets (tube holders) There are several types of bucket for use with electric centrifuges (Fig. 3.40). The choice depends on the model of centrifuge: — buckets designed to hold one round-bottomed or conical tube only; — buckets that hold two round-bottomed or conical tubes; — buckets that hold nine small (precipitin) tubes, etc. Some models are also fitted with: — a timer that stops the centrifuge automatically when the time is up (e.g. after 5 or 10 minutes); — a cooling chamber that prevents heating of the specimen during centrifuging; — a revolution counter, i.e. a dial with a needle that indicates the speed of the machine during centrifuging (this is useful for some methods of concentration of parasites)."

It is important for the prevention of accidents that the correct procedures for the measurement and dispensing of these liquids are clearly under- stood and are followed conscientiously. Many of the new procedures for analysis require very small volumes of fluid and various pipetting and dispensing devices are available to enable small volumes to be measured with great precision. Large volumes can be measured using a measuring cylinder or a volumetric flask. A measuring cylinder measures various volumes of fluid but is not very accurate. A volumetric flask measures a single volume of fluid, e.g. 1 litre, accurately. Small volumes of fluid (0.1–10ml) can be dispensed rapidly and accurately using one of the following methods: G A fixed or variable volume dispenser attached to a reservoir made of glass or polypropylene.

General laboratory procedures 95 3.7.2 Fixation and dispatch of biopsy specimens for histopathological examination Biopsy specimens To diagnose certain diseases of the organs, the physician removes a piece of tissue with forceps or a special scalpel. This piece of tissue is called a biopsy specimen. It is examined under the microscope after a thin section has been cut and treated with a special stain. Histopathology The cells of biopsy specimens from tissues and organs can be studied under the microscope. This type of examination is called histopathology and can be most important, particularly for the diagnosis of cancer. The laboratory technician must be able to fix the biopsy specimen and to ensure that it is properly dispatched and arrives at the pathology laboratory in a good state of preservation. Fixation of biopsy specimens The piece of tissue is immersed in a fixative fluid. This procedure should preserve the tissue in a state as close to the living state as possible, by protecting it against bacterial action, autolysis, shrinkage, etc. The most suitable type of bottle for biopsy specimens is a plastic-capped bottle with a wide mouth (pill bottle). Such bottles are obtainable in 60-ml, 45-ml, 30-ml and 15-ml sizes. Fixatives Fixatives that are simple to prepare are: — formaldehyde saline (reagent no. 27); — Zenker fixative (reagent no. 66). Just before use, add 5ml of glacial acetic acid per 100ml of Zenker solution."

Table 4.4 summarizes the features used for the differential diagnosis of Entamoeba histolytica and E. coli. If a trophozoite moves quickly in one direction and projects pseudopodia rapidly, it is probably Entamoeba histolytica. Other species of amoeba do not usually move like this. If the trophozoite moves as described and if erythrocytes are present in the cytoplasm, it can be assumed that it is E. histolytica. If necessary, buffered methylene blue can be used to stain the nucleus for con firmation. Entamoeba hartmanni (Fig. 4.16) Size: always less than 10 mm (about the size of an erythrocyte).

(If the peripheral chromatin is absent, the cyst is not a species of Entamoeba.) These peripheral chromatoid bodies stain light yellow and may not be very clear.

Shape Each species has its own particular shape. Stage of development when passed The eggs of some species consist of a single cell, some eggs have several cells, and some eggs are usually embryonated, i.e. they contain a larva. Occasionally, if stool specimens are 1 –2 days old, eggs may develop to more advanced stages. Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) eggs usually have only one cell when passed in the faeces; however, the single cell may divide and, in specimens over 12 hours old, eggs with two or four cells may be seen. Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus (hookworm) eggs present in specimens that are several hours old may contain 16, 32 or more cells."

Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus (hookworm) eggs present in specimens that are several hours old may contain 16, 32 or more cells. After 12 –24 hours, the eggs may be embryonated and later still the larvae may hatch. When observing the stage of development of helminth eggs, be sure that the stool specimen is freshly passed. If it is several hours or a day old, expect to see changes in the stage of development of some species. Ideally only fresh samples should be accepted for diagnosis. Thickness of the egg shell The eggs of some species such as Ascaris lumbricoides have thick shells, whereas others such as Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus have thin shells. Colour The eggs of some species such as Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus and Enterobius vermicularis are colourless, whereas others such as Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura are yellow or brown. Other characteristics The presence of characteristics such as opercula (lids), spines, plugs, hooklets or mammilated outer coats can also be aids to identi fication.

G The egg can be measured by inserting a micrometer scale slide in the eyepiece of the microscope. One division of the scale using the ¥ 10 objective and the ¥ 10 eyepiece = 1mm.

Results Under the light microscope microfilariae appear (after appropriate staining) as primitive organisms, serpentine in shape, often enclosed in a sheath and filled with the nuclei of many cells (Fig. 4.128). Not all species have a sheath. In those that do, the sheath may extend a short or long distance beyond either extremity. In some species, depending on the stain used, the sheath displays a unique staining quality which aids in species identification.

Some of these structures and their positions are useful in identifying the species. Other useful features include the shape of the tail and the presence or absence of nuclei within it. Table 4.8 summarizes the features of common human filarial parasites that are used in their identification. Note: G Sometimes the micro filariae of the periodic strain of Brugia malayi lose their sheath. G Identification of species can be dif ficult and mistakes are frequently made. The guidelines for the identi fication of microfilariae given above and those that appear in most textbooks make identification seem deceptively simple. Sometimes it is difficult to see the sheath. At other times, the nuclei do not appear in their characteristic position at the tip of the tail. It is good practice to examine several microfilariae carefully, before deciding on their species. If a systematic study is made of all the characteristics mentioned above, it should be possible to identify with certainty the species observed. The identi fication must not be based on a single characteristic, but on all the features taken together. Fig. 4.128 Microfi lariae found in humans R1, R2, R3, R4: rectal cells.

These begin to rupture after 5 –20 days, according to the species, and the released merozoites invade circulating erythrocytes. The replication cycle is repeated at regular intervals. Clinical symptoms The first clinical symptoms of infection are low-grade fever, headaches, muscle aches and malaise. These symptoms are often misinterpreted as being the result of a viral influenza infection. The influenza-like symptoms are followed by recurrent, periodic attacks of high fever and shivering. If high temperatures are accompanied by mental disturbances marked by hallucinations and cerebral excitation, this may indicate cerebral malaria, which is often fatal. In areas in which malaria is endemic and where the population has developed partial immunity to the disease, the clinical symptoms may be more moderate. Plasmodium species infective to humans There are four different species of Plasmodium infective to humans. These are P . falciparum, P . malariae, P . ovale and P . vivax.

Routine method for staining thick and thin blood fi lms Ideally, for optimum staining, thick and thin films should be made on separate slides. This is often not possible and thick and thin films are generally made on the same slide. When this is done, good-quality staining of the thick film is of primary importance. Best results are obtained if the blood films have dried overnight. This method is suitable for staining 20 or more slides. 1. Fix the thin film by adding three drops of methanol, or by dipping it into a container of methanol for a few seconds. With prolonged fixation it may be difficult to detect Schüffner’s dots and Maurer’s clefts.

In patients who have recently received an injection of an antimalarial drug, the parasites stain poorly and appear distorted and indistinct. Thick blood films In thick blood films, the background should be clean and free from debris, as the infected erythrocytes are lysed. The malaria parasites should have deep red chromatin and blue or pale purplish-blue cytoplasm. In thick films stained with Giemsa, the nuclei of leukocytes should be stained dark purple. Sch üffner’s dots may be seen around the malaria parasites. Thick blood films are used for estimating the parasite density, as described below. Parasite density The parasite density is the number of parasites counted in each microscope field. It usually varies according to the species. Two methods can be used to count malaria parasites in thick blood films: determination of the number of parasites per microlitre (ml) of blood, and the plus system.

Parasitology 183 African trypanosomiasis African trypanosomiasis occurs in three phases: — the acute phase — the parasitaemic phase — the neurological phase. Two or 3 days after the bite of an infected tsetse fly, a chancre appears at the inoculation site; it disappears within 2 –3 weeks. From the site of the chancre, the trypanosomes invade the bloodstream, giving rise to occasional episodes of intermittent fever. The most common symptoms of the first or acute phase are head- ache, sleeplessness, pain in the joints and posterior lymph nodes of the neck, swelling of the eyelids and joints, weight loss and generalized intense itching, especially in the region of the breast bone. Invasion of the central nervous system causes irritability, paraesthesia, sleeplessness and eventually severe headaches and blurred vi- sion, as well as epileptic attacks, psychotic phenomena, drowsiness, mental lethargy and coma. Trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense generally has a slow and chronic course. Between the first and second phases, weeks or months can pass, and months or years may elapse between the second and third phases. Trypanosomiasis caused by T .b. rhodesiense follows a more acute course and the phases are less marked. It may cause death within a few months."

Trypanosomiasis caused by T .b. rhodesiense follows a more acute course and the phases are less marked. It may cause death within a few months. Heart complications are more frequent in trypanosomiasis caused by T .b. rhodesiense, and some patients die before reaching the neurological phase. Sources of infection and modes of transmission African trypanosomiasis is transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina spp.) and humans are the main reservoir of infection. Pigs, dogs and possibly other animal species can also harbour the parasite, but their role in spreading the disease is secondary. Transmission occurs when tsetse flies ingest the blood of infected humans or animals. Examination of lymph node aspirates for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and T.b. rhodesiense In patients with African trypanosomiasis trypanosomes are found in the lymph glands in the early stage, i.e. 2 –3 weeks after infection.

Patients with the chronic form of the disease may deny having ever experienced the acute form, possibly because it passed asymptomatically or because it occurred in childhood and has been forgotten. Sources of infection and modes of transmission In Chagas disease the parasite ( Trypanosoma cruzi ) is transmitted by bugs of the genus Triatoma that become infected by ingesting the blood of infected humans or animals. The parasite multiplies in the intestine of the triatomine bug. Humans are infected when the wound at the site of a triatomine bite is contaminated with the infected faeces of the bug. There is a serious risk that Chagas disease may be transmitted via blood transfusion if proper precautions are not taken. Diagnostic tests for Chagas disease Trypanosoma rangeli infects humans in almost the same areas as T. cruzi.

It can affect the skin (cutaneous leishmaniasis), mucous membranes (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) and the reticuloendothelial system (visceral leishmaniasis or kala-azar). The incubation period is generally from 2 to 6 months, but can vary from 10 days to several years. In some patients a primary lesion forms several months before the other symptoms appear. Amastigotes of the Leishmania spp. multiply slowly in macrophages near the site of inoculation. Some infected macrophages enter the bloodstream and reach the viscera, where the amastigotes multiply rapidly."

Amastigotes of the Leishmania spp. multiply slowly in macrophages near the site of inoculation. Some infected macrophages enter the bloodstream and reach the viscera, where the amastigotes multiply rapidly. Clinically, the early phases of visceral leishmaniasis are characterized by chronic irregular fever, cough, diarrhoea and bleeding of the mucous membranes and secondary infections. Later, progressive enlargement of the spleen, liver and, occa- sionally, the lymph nodes, weight loss and — in some patients — patchy hypopigmentation of the skin occur. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is characterized by skin ulcers, which may be single or multiple. In certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis plaques, papules or nodules may appear in different parts of the body. The clinical symptoms of leishmaniasis may be similar to those found in schistosomiasis, chronic malaria and chronic leukaemia.

Microscopic examination The eggs of Schistosoma haematobium are large, about 120–150mm long, and have a terminal spine at one end (Fig. 7.41 (a)). An embryo (the miracidium) can be seen inside the egg. Sometimes it is necessary to determine whether the eggs are viable. This can be done if the specimen is fresh and no preservatives have been added. Look carefully at the eggs to see if the embryos are moving. This is the best indication of viability. If no movement is seen, look for the “flame cells” (Fig. 7.41 (b)). There are four flame cells, one at each corner of the embryo. Use a ¥100 objective with slightly reduced illumination to look for the rapid movement of cilia (short hairs) in the flame cells.

Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 255 8.Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is contained in the cavity that surrounds the brain in the skull and the spinal cord in the spinal column (Fig. 8.1). It supplies nutrients to the tissues of the central nervous system and helps to protect the brain and spinal cord from injury. The volume of the CSF in adults is 100–150ml. The volume is less in children and varies according to the body length. 8.1 Common reasons for investigation of CSF The most common reasons for investigating CSF are to exclude: — meningitis — bleeding into the central nervous system — certain cancers. Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes lining the skull and covering the brain and spinal column. It is often caused by infection (see Table 8.1). Leukaemia, tumours with manifestations in the brain and lead poisoning have also been shown to cause meningitis. Note: Immediate laboratory investigation of the CSF may be life-saving if meningitis is suspected. 8.2 Collection of CSF specimens CSF specimens should be collected only by a physician or a specially trained nurse."

For example, if the volume of erythrocytes in 1 litre (1000ml) of blood is 450ml, the erythrocyte volume fraction is 450ml/1000ml = 0.45 (since the fraction is millilitres divided by millilitres, the unit “ml” cancels out, and the result is a simple decimal fraction with no unit)."

The remainder of the blood is made up almost entirely of plasma, together with a small volume of leukocytes. If the latter are ignored, the plasma volume fraction in the above example would be 550ml/1000ml = 0.55 (note that 0.45 + 0.55 = 1.0; i.e. erythrocyte volume fraction plus plasma volume fraction = 1). The erythrocyte volume fraction is therefore a measure of the proportion of erythrocytes to plasma.

Low values Low values are found in patients suffering from anaemia. In men with anaemia the erythrocyte volume fraction is lower than 0.4 and in women it is lower than 0.37 (packed cell volumes of 40% and 37%, respectively). High values High values are found in cases of loss of plasma, severe burns, dehydration (as in diarrhoeal diseases) and also (rarely) in polycythaemia. Relationship between the erythrocyte number concentration and the erythrocyte volume fraction Normally, there is a linear relationship between the erythrocyte number concentration and the erythrocyte volume fraction. If the erythrocyte number concentration is C ¥ 10 12 per litre, the erythrocyte volume fraction will normally be in the range (C - 0.2)/10 to (C - 0.4)/10. Example: If the erythrocyte number concentration is 5 ¥ 1012/l, the erythrocyte volume fraction will normally be in the range (5 - 0.2)/10 to (5 - 0.4)/10; i.e., 0.48 to 0.46. In traditional units, the relationship is similar, but the formula for the calculation is slightly different: if C is the erythrocyte count, the packed cell volume (haematocrit), as a percentage, will normally be in the range ( C ¥ 10) - 2 to (C ¥ 10) - 4. Relationship between the erythrocyte volume fraction and the haemoglobin concentration Normally, there is a linear relationship between the erythrocyte volume fraction and the haemoglobin concentration. The erythrocyte volume fraction is about 0.003 times the haemoglobin concentration when the latter is expressed in grams per litre. If the haemoglobin concentration is expressed in terms of millimoles of haemoglobin(Fe) per litre, the erythrocyte volume fraction is roughly 0.05 times the figure for grams per litre. Example: A person with a haemoglobin concentration of 130g/l will normally have an erythrocyte volume fraction of 130 ¥ 0.003 = 0.39. In terms of haemoglobin(Fe), the Table 9.6 Normal erythrocyte volume fractions and packed cell volumes, by age group Age group Erythrocyte volume fraction Packed cell volume (%) Newborn infants 0.50 –0.58 50 –58 Infants (3 months) 0.35 –0.40 35 –40 Children (5 years) 0.38 –0.44 38 –44 Women 0.37 –0.43 37 –43 Men 0.40 –0.50 40 –50 <> 9.

Haematology 285 concentration is about 8.0mmol/l, and the erythrocyte volume fraction will be about 8.0 ¥ 0.05 = 0.4. Additional information provided by the erythrocyte volume fraction test Examine the layer of leukocytes just above the column of erythrocytes (see Fig. 9.34). It is normally very thin; if it seems thick, determine the leukocyte number concentration (see section 9.6). The layer will seem abnormally thick if the leukocyte number concentration is greater than 20 ¥ 10 9/l. In cases of leukaemia, when the leukocyte number concentration may be 100 –200 ¥ 109/l, the layer may be several millimetres thick. Mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration The mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration is a measure of the average haemoglobin content of the erythrocytes. It is expressed either in grams of haemo- globin per litre or in millimoles of haemoglobin(Fe) per litre 1 and is calculated by dividing the haemoglobin concentration of the blood by the erythrocyte volume fraction. Example: G If the haemoglobin concentration is expressed in grams of haemoglobin per litre: haemoglobin concentration = 150g/l erythrocyte volume fraction = 0.43 mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration = 150/0.43 = 349g/l (or 34.9%). G If the haemoglobin concentration is expressed in millimoles of haemoglobin(Fe) per litre: haemoglobin(Fe) = 9.3mmol/l erythrocyte volume fraction = 0.43 mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration = 9.3/0.43 = 21.6mmol/l."

G If the haemoglobin concentration is expressed in millimoles of haemoglobin(Fe) per litre: haemoglobin(Fe) = 9.3mmol/l erythrocyte volume fraction = 0.43 mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration = 9.3/0.43 = 21.6mmol/l. Note: to convert values in g/l to values in mmol/l, multiply by 0.06206. Thus, using the above example, 349g/l ¥ 0.06206 = 21.6mmol/l. Reference values Normally the mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration lies between the following limits: — lower limit: haemoglobin 322g/l or haemoglobin(Fe) 20mmol/l; — upper limit: haemoglobin 371g/l or haemoglobin(Fe) 23mmol/l. When the value falls within this range, the erythrocytes are said to be “normochromic” (i.e. of normal colour). Values below the lower limit of the reference range indicate that the erythrocytes are “hypochromic” (i.e. less coloured than normal). Low values are found in patients with hypochromic anaemia. If the value is higher than the upper limit of the reference range, the mean erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration should be determined again. Haemoglobin forms about 95% of the erythrocyte mass. Therefore, erythrocytes are never “hyperchromic” (i.e. more coloured than normal), but they may increase in volume and thus be capable of containing more haemoglobin than normal; in this case the mean 1 See note about expression of haemoglobin concentration on page 284. <> 286 Manual of basic techniques for a health laboratory erythrocyte haemoglobin concentration may be as high as 380g/l (haemoglobin(Fe) 23.6mmol/l), but it never exceeds these values.

Anaemia may result from: — blood loss — decreased production of erythrocytes — increased destruction of erythrocytes. The most common cause of anaemia worldwide is iron deficiency. Other common causes such as infection, malaria, malnutrition and vitamin de ficiencies usually contribute to anaemia in association with iron deficiency. Other causes of anaemia are: — trauma — parasitic infections — diseases of the endocrine system — chronic diseases — inborn errors of metabolism — intoxication. 9.6 Estimation of the leukocyte number concentration The number of leukocytes contained in 1 litre of blood is called the leukocyte number concentration or leukocyte count.

In leukaemia, leukocyte number concentrations of 50 ¥ 10 9/l to 400 ¥ 109/l, or even higher values, can be found. In this case it is necessary, when determining the number concentration, to use a greater dilution of blood — for example 0.05ml of blood and 1.95ml of diluting fluid, which gives a dilution of 1 in 40.

Normoblasts are not haemolysed in the diluting fluid and are therefore counted with the leukocytes.

Place the tube in the Westergren stand, making sure that the tube is completely upright (Fig. 9.48). Check that there are no air bubbles in the tube. Check that the stand is level. 6. Leave on a bench away from vibration (e.g. not on the same bench as a centrifuge), free from draughts, not close to a central heating radiator and not in direct sunlight. 7. Wait 1 hour (set the timer to ring), then note the height of the column of plasma in mm graduations starting from the 0-mm mark at the top of the tube (Fig. 9.49). 9.7.4 Results The result is expressed in millimetres per hour (mm/h). Reference range Table 9.9 shows the reference ranges for adults. Note: If a patient is dehydrated measurement of the ESR has little value. High values Any disease that produces plasma protein changes will increase the ESR. These include acute and chronic infections, myocardial infarctions and rheumatoid arthritis.

The number of reticulocytes in the blood indicates the degree of activity of the bone marrow in the production of erythrocytes, and when the marrow is very active (as in anaemia) their number increases. Reticulocytes contain fine, deep-violet granules arranged in a network (reticulum). They do not contain a nucleus. 9.12.1 Principle The fine granules in reticulocytes can be stained with brilliant cresyl blue.

Look at the end of the smear, where the erythrocytes should be well separated from each other. Erythrocytes stain pale blue. Examine at least 100 erythrocytes. Keep a careful count of the total number of erythrocytes examined and the number of these that are reticulocytes. (Counting is easier if the size of the microscope field is reduced. This can be done by placing in the eyepiece a small circular piece of stiff black paper in which a hole of about 5mm in diameter has been punched.) Some haematologists prefer reticulocytes to be reported in terms of the number concentration (number of reticulocytes per litre of blood), while others prefer them to be reported in terms of the number fraction (the proportion of erythrocytes that are reticulocytes). Depending on the practice in your laboratory or the speci fication of the requesting physician, make the appropriate calculation. 1 Fig. 9.108 Preparing the cresyl blue solution Fig. 9.109 Collecting a capillary blood sample 1 Traditionally, reticulocytes have been reported in the form of percentages (i.e. the proportion, expressed as a percentage, of the erythrocytes that are reticulocytes).

In a badly spread film, the neutrophils may have collected at the end of the film. To record the different types of leukocytes as they are counted, proceed as follows: Draw up a table with: —fi ve vertical columns (N, E, B, L and M), and — 10 horizontal lines (see Fig. 9.111). When 10 strokes have been made in the first line, go on to the next. Thus, when the 10th line has been completed, you know that you have counted 100 leukocytes. Then add up the total for each vertical column. These totals give the percentage of each type of leukocyte. The totals are turned into decimal fractions by placing a decimal point two digits to the left (in some cases this may necessitate the insertion of a zero). Thus 59 becomes 0.59, 8 becomes 0.08, 1 becomes 0.01, 28 becomes 0.28, etc., as in the last line of the illus- tration. These decimals are the number fractions of each type of leukocyte and are the results that are reported when SI units are used. Reference range Table 9.12 shows the reference ranges for different age groups. 1 In the traditional system, the leukocyte type number fractions are called the “differential leukocyte (or white cell) count”, and the proportion of each type is reported as a percentage (e.g. neutrophils 56%, lymphocytes 25%, eosinophils 12%, monocytes 6% and basophils 1% in the example given above). <> 320 Manual of basic techniques for a health laboratory There are two main patterns of distribution of different types of leukocyte: G One pattern shows a majority of lymphocytes (this type is seen in infants and children under 10 years).

Each type of leukocyte may be reported in terms of its number concentration (i.e. number of cells per litre) instead of as a number fraction. The number concentration is calculated by multiplying the number fraction of a particular type of leukocyte by the total leukocyte number concentration.

Immunological and serological techniques Many of the diagnostic techniques applied in immunology are based on the fact that antigens and antibodies interact. Most infectious diseases are diagnosed by isolating and identifying the infectious microorganism in a specimen from the patient. In some cases microorganisms are difficult to culture and isolate or may re- quire special and often expensive techniques that are not available for routine diagnosis. In other immunological disorders there is no microorganism per se to identify or isolate. There are also some “naturally” occurring immune diseases, often classified as autoimmune diseases, which are not caused by a microorganism but can be detected by some of the diagnostic techniques applied in immunology. Several of these techniques detect specific metabolic products or specific antibodies and antigens. In those disease states where a microorganism is involved, these immunology tests do not detect the microorganism directly, but provide evidence of its presence. A number of diagnostic techniques based on biological reactions using antigen– antibody interactions are described. It is beyond the scope of this manual to go into detail about the immune system. The aim here is to introduce some terminology and general concepts of the immune system, which will help in understanding some of the immunological techniques described.

In those disease states where a microorganism is involved, these immunology tests do not detect the microorganism directly, but provide evidence of its presence. A number of diagnostic techniques based on biological reactions using antigen– antibody interactions are described. It is beyond the scope of this manual to go into detail about the immune system. The aim here is to introduce some terminology and general concepts of the immune system, which will help in understanding some of the immunological techniques described. Note that various approaches are available for different diagnostic purposes; the choice should be based upon the ques- tion asked and the availability of facilities. The diagnostic techniques described here are those most frequently used as an aid in the diagnosis of certain diseases that cause an immunological reaction. 11.1 Introduction to immunology The role of the immune system is defence. The immune system has both nonspecific and specific mechanisms to recognize and respond accordingly to foreign and potentially pathogenic microorganisms. The non-specific defences are physical or mechanical barriers, for example, the skin and mucous membranes. These barriers are there to prevent entry of pathogens into the body. These barriers usually work very well, but some pathogens do manage to enter the body where they are immediately destroyed by phagocytic cells such as macrophages. When pathogenic microorganisms enter the body the specific defence mechanisms are activated. The specific mechanisms are divided into the humoral (antibodymediated) and the cell-mediated systems. The humoral system is associated with cells known as B-lymphocytes, which are the precursors of plasma cells. Plasma cells produce and secrete protein substances known as antibodies or immunoglobulins. The cell-mediated system is associated with T -lymphocytes which can process and destroy foreign bodies. 11.1.1 Antibodies Antibodies are found in serum, milk, saliva, tears, urine and other body fluids."

The cell-mediated system is associated with T -lymphocytes which can process and destroy foreign bodies. 11.1.1 Antibodies Antibodies are found in serum, milk, saliva, tears, urine and other body fluids. In neonates, antibody production is virtually absent and protection is provided by maternal antibodies mainly through breast milk and those that cross the placenta. A growing infant is constantly exposed to various environmental antigens which <> 11. Immunological and serological techniques 329 promote production of antibodies. In humans there are five major classes of antibodies or immunoglobulins: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE and IgD. These proteins differ in their electrophoretic mobility, relative molecular mass, antigenic structure, sedimentation coefficient, shape and other properties. All the immunoglobulins have a structure composed of four polypeptide chains with two long or heavy (H) chains and two short or light (L) chains (Fig. 11.1). Within these H and L chains there are regions known as constant regions, where amino acid sequences are very similar, and variable regions (usually at the ends of the chains), where amino acid sequences are highly variable. The variable regions give the different antibodies their speci ficity. 11.1.2 Antigens Antigens are molecules (usually proteins) that can elicit an immune response. Antigens have sites on them known as antigenic determinants which can be recognized by antibodies. Antigens may have several determinants of different configuration or several of the same configuration such that antibodies of the same kind or of several different kinds can bind to these sites. Several properties can influence the immunogenicity of an antigen; these are briefly discussed below. Recognition of the antigen as a foreign substance The most important property of an antigen is that which allows the body to recognize the substance as foreign. An individual ’s immune system is normally capable of distinguishing substances belonging to the body from those that do not (self from non-self)."

Several properties can influence the immunogenicity of an antigen; these are briefly discussed below. Recognition of the antigen as a foreign substance The most important property of an antigen is that which allows the body to recognize the substance as foreign. An individual ’s immune system is normally capable of distinguishing substances belonging to the body from those that do not (self from non-self). Certain conditions incapacitate the self-tolerance mechanism and the system starts to react against itself. Relative molecular mass The relative molecular mass or size of an antigen also affects its immunogenicity. As a general rule, large molecules make good antigens (i.e. they are effective in generating an immune response), provided they are foreign to the body. Small molecules are usually poor antigens. Complexity The more complex the molecule, the better the immune response to the antigen. Complex proteins make “better” antigens than repeating polymers of lipids, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Stability It is essential for the antigen to be stable for it to be recognized by the immune system. Degradability The substance must be degradable. In order to initiate an immune response the immune system must be able to process the substance. Route of antigen administration and dosage Antigens must be administered correctly. Some substances elicit an immune response if administered subcutaneously, but not if administered intravenously.

The antigen determinant (the “lock”) has a predetermined conformation and only a speci fic antibody (the “key”) with the appropriate variable regions (grooves and contours) will give a perfect fit. However, the situation is not always so clear-cut. Sometimes an antigen will combine (poorly) with an antibody that was produced against a different antigen, causing cross-reactivity. To avoid these unwanted interactions, it is important to know and define the analytical sensitivity and speci ficity of immunological tests based on antibody–antigen reactions. The analytical sensitivity of an immunological test refers to its ability to detect small quantities of antigen or antibody. It is used as a synonym for the limit of detection. The analytical specificity of an immunological test is its ability to measure only the substance it purports to measure. 1 These are important considerations, especially when choosing a new test. Others include: applicability in a given laboratory environment, cost, availability, level of expertise required, speed and simplicity. 11.2 Principle of immunochemical techniques Antigen–antibody reactions can be classified into three groups: primary, secondary and tertiary binding reactions.

Tertiary reactions follow secondary reactions and usually occur in vivo. 11.2.1 Primary binding tests This group of tests provides a direct measure of the initial binding reaction between an antigen and an antibody. This is a very sensitive approach for which a label is needed to detect the binding reaction. Such tests include radioimmunoassays, enzyme immunoassays and immuno fluorescence assays. Radioimmunoassay In a radioimmunoassay, either an antigen or an antibody is conjugated with a radioactive tracer substance and the radioactivity is measured with a scintillation counter (Fig. 11.2). This type of assay is becoming less common, partly because of the need for radioactive substances and also because the measuring equipment required is difficult to use.

Immunological and serological techniques 331 Enzyme immunoassay In an enzyme immunoassay, an antigen or antibody is conjugated with a labelled enzyme and a colour change is produced by the enzyme reacting with its substrate. This change can be detected visually or with a spectrophotometer. The binding event can be either competitive or non-competitive. Competitive binding depends on competition between a labelled (known amount) and an unlabelled (unknown amount) antigen for the same antibody (when measuring antigen) or between a labelled (known amount) and an unlabelled (unknown amount) antibody for the same antigen (when measuring antibody) (Fig. 11.3). The amount of binding of the labelled antigen (or antibody) is related to the amount of unlabelled antigen (or antibody) present. In non-competitive binding (sandwich technique), the antigen or antibody is adsorbed (or immobilized) to a solid phase, which may be an insoluble particle (bead) or the sides of a test-tube or the bottom of a microtitre plate. The test sample containing the corresponding antibody or antigen is then added. A labelled antibody or antigen (conjugate) is added last to form the top layer of the sandwich (Fig. 11.4). When testing for an antibody, the conjugate would contain anti-immunoglobulin and when testing for an antigen, the conjugate would contain an antibody speci fic for that antigen. The amount of binding of the conjugate is directly related to the amount of antigen or antibody in the test sample and only the bound portion is measured in this assay."

An example of this technique is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The enzymes used in ELISAs include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, lysozyme and b-galactosidase. The enzyme immunoassays are replacing many radioimmunoassays because of their advantages over the latter, which include longer reagent shelf-life, cheaper and simpler equipment, no restrictive regulations for reagent disposal, and safer reagents.

Fluorescence occurs when molecules that have been excited to a higher energy state return to their normal energy state. The excess energy is released in the form of light. A fluorescent microscope, which is a modified light microscope, is used to visualize the light emitted. Two types of immunofluorescence technique can be used. Direct immunofluorescence Direct immunofluorescence is used when testing for an antigen. In this technique a fluorescent dye is linked to the isolated portion of an antiserum containing antibodies directed against a speci fic component of cells or tissue. The antiserum is applied directly to the tissue specimen. The antigen and antibody react, then the tissue specimen is washed. The tissue specimen is examined under the microscope and fluorescence is seen where the antibody is attached to the antigen (Fig. 11.5). Indirect immunofluorescence Indirect immunofluorescence is used to determine whether antibodies are present in a patient’s serum. The serum is applied directly to an appropriate tissue specimen containing an antigen directed against the speci fic antibody under investiga- tion. The antigen and antibody react, then the tissue specimen is washed. An anti-immunoglobulin with a fluorescent label is added and the tissue specimen is then incubated before being washed again. The labelled anti-immunoglobulin will attach to any antibody already bound to the antigen in the tissue specimen and shows up under the microscope as areas of fluorescence (Fig."

The labelled anti-immunoglobulin will attach to any antibody already bound to the antigen in the tissue specimen and shows up under the microscope as areas of fluorescence (Fig. 11.6). The indirect method is more sensitive than the direct method because it is ampli fied in the sense that each unlabelled antibody can be bound by two labelled antibodies. 11.2.2 Secondary binding tests The secondary binding tests enable visible manifestations following the primary reaction to be observed. In these tests one can actually see the effects of the binding event without the aid of an additional label. These tests include agglutination, precipitation, complement-dependent reactions and neutralization methods. The agglutination and precipitation methods are routinely employed for diagnostic purposes. These methods are briefly described below.

The interaction of surface antigens and antibodies directed against them leads to cross-linking of adjacent particles, e.g. bacteria, to form a lattice of agglutinated cells. Active agglutination (direct) Active agglutination involves antigenic determinants that are an intrinsic constituent of the particle, e.g. haemagglutination reactions used for blood grouping. Passive agglutination (indirect) Passive agglutination involves antigenic determinants that are not an intrinsic constituent of the particle. A soluble antigen is combined with insoluble particles such as erythrocytes. The erythrocytes are usually treated with tannic acid, which alters their surface properties so that the antigen can bind firmly. Other insoluble particles include bacteria, charcoal, bentonite (clay) and polyvinyl latex where the anti- gen is simply adsorbed. Semi-quantitative titrations can be carried out to determine the amount of antibody present in a sample. A constant volume of suspended particles (antigen) is added to a constant volume of serially diluted antiserum. The presence of antibody in the serum causes agglutination of the particles (Fig. 11.8) and the reaction is usually scored on a scale of 0 to 4 +.

If soluble antigen is present in the sample, the antibody reacts with it and is not free to react further after the subsequent addition of indicator particles or cells. Thus, the absence of agglutination with a specimen under investigation indicates a positive test result. An example of this kind of assay is the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) used in the test for con firmation of pregnancy and also in other pathological conditions where hCG levels are important (Fig. 11.9). Precipitation Unlike agglutination reactions in which the antigen is particulate (insoluble), in precipitation reactions the interaction is between a soluble antibody and a soluble antigen.

These techniques are used to measure concentrations of proteins and drugs in serum or CSF. The assays are rapid and sensitive. A constant, excessive amount of antibody is incubated with an antigen in a cuvette. In nephelometry light is passed through the cuvette and the scatter produced by the antigen–antibody complexes that have been formed is measured.

Radial immunodiffusion (Mancini technique) Radial immunodiffusion is based on the principle that a quantitative relationship exists between the amount of antigen placed in a well cut in an agarose gel containing antibody and the diameter of the resulting ring of precipitate. The antigen concentration is proportional to the square of the diameter of the ring of precipitate. The concentration of unknown samples is calculated with the aid of a standard curve which is prepared by plotting the diameter 2 of the resulting ring of precipitate produced by a series of antigen solutions of known concentration (Fig. 11.11). This technique can be used for the quantitative measurement of complement factors and immunoglobulins.

Semi-quantitative analysis Semi-quantitative analysis may be desirable in some cases where the production of b-hCG may have a pathological cause. This may occur in both pregnant and nonpregnant patients. Make a twofold dilution of the positive urine samples and examine as described in steps 2–5 above. The highest dilution that does not cause agglutination is the titre. The results for this semi-quantitative analysis are reported in IU/ml which can be obtained by multiplying the dilution factor of the highest dilution that does not cause agglutination by the sensitivity or limit of detection of the method, as stated by the manufacturer. 11.6 Quantitative determination of IgA, IgG and IgM by radial immunodiffusion 11.6.1 Materials and reagents G Siliconized glass plates 8cm ¥ 12cm, or Petri dishes (glass or plastic) G Boxes with tightly fitting lids G Hole-punch with inner diameter of 2mm <> 340 Manual of basic techniques for a health laboratory G Pipettes, 5 ml G Water-bath G Thermometer G Test-tubes G Test-tube racks G Agar, 3% solution in distilled water G Sodium chloride, 0.15mol/l with 0.1% sodium azide G Agarose or agar G Anti-human IgA antiserum G Anti-human IgG antiserum G Anti-human IgM antiserum G Human standard serum containing: — IgA 2.0mg/ml (123IU/ml) — IgG 9.5mg/ml (110IU/ml) — IgM 0.96mg/ml (111IU/ml)."

Hepatitis A is most common in children, especially in nurseries; however, it is not routinely tested for, except in cases of epidemics. Hepatitis B and C viruses are transmitted through blood products, body fluids, contaminated needles and other contaminated materials. Hepatitis B virus has several markers which include: — surface antigen (HBsAg) — antibody to surface antigen (anti-HBs) — envelope antigen (HBeAg) — antibody to envelope antigen (anti-HBe) — antibody to core antigen (anti-HBc).

There are four stages of syphilis infection: primary, secondary, latent and tertiary, and a special condition of maternal –fetal transmission termed congenital syphilis. Immune responses to syphilis can be grouped into two categories: non-specific (or reaginic) and speci fic. The non-speci fic reagin is of the IgM class and reacts with an alcoholic extract of beef heart known as cardiolipin (a phospholipid). Since the reaginic antibody lacks speci ficity, it shows up in many other conditions and disease states unrelated to treponemal infection. In these cases false-positive reactions can occur.

Principle RPR test The RPR test has replaced the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test, as a rapid screening test for the following reasons: G There is no need for daily preparation of reagents. G No microscope is required. G Heat inactivation of serum is not required. The RPR test uses the VDRL antigen modified with choline chloride to inactivate complement, and charcoal particles to allow the results of the reaction to be read without a microscope. The RPR test can also be applied as a semi-quantitative test. FTA-Abs test The FTA-Abs test is used in the con firmation of syphilis. In the first step of the test, serum is diluted in a concentrated culture filtrate of Reiter treponemes to absorb any antibodies to nonpathogenic treponemes.

In the first step of the test, serum is diluted in a concentrated culture filtrate of Reiter treponemes to absorb any antibodies to nonpathogenic treponemes. The serum is then layered over a glass slide on which killed T. pallidum organisms (Nichols strain) have been affixed. The slide is incubated, washed and overlaid with a fluorescent-labelled antihuman immunoglobulin antibody. If the test result is positive the treponemes will fluoresce. This indirect immunofluorescence technique is highly sensitive in all stages of syphilis, especially in the very early and very late stages. Once positive this test remains positive for the life of the patient. It is not used as a screening test for syphilis because it does not detect reinfection and it is time-consuming and costly (a fluorescence microscope with a dark- field condenser is required). The results of a test for syphilis must be interpreted according to the type(s) of test employed and the stage of the disease the patient has reached. Remember that a <> 11.

G The disease is latent or inactive. G The patient has not produced protective antibodies because of immunological tolerance. G The technique is faulty. Weakly positive results may be due to: — very early infection; — lessening of the activity of the disease after treatment; — nonspecific immunological reactions; — incorrect technique. The greatest value of the non-treponemal tests is in screening following therapy and in the detection of reinfection. TPHA test The TPHA test is also used in the con firmation of syphilis. In the first step of the test, diluted serum is mixed with absorbing diluent containing non-pathogenic Reiter treponemes. The serum is then transferred to a microtitre plate and erythrocytes sensitized with killed T. pallidum organisms (Nichols strain) are added.

These books are closely tied to the Organization’s priority activities, encompassing disease prevention and control, the development of equitable health systems based on primary health care, and health promotion for individuals and communities. Progress towards better health for all also demands the global dissemination and exchange of information that draws on the knowledge and experience of all WHO’s Member countries and the collaboration of world leaders in public health and the biomedical sciences. To ensure the widest possible availability of authoritative information and guidance on health matters, WHO secures the broad international distribution of its publications and encourages their translation and adaptation.
